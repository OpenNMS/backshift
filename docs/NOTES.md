Notes
=====

* Backshift will maintain a view of the series that can be used for plotting
* The resolution of the data will be scaled dynamically to fit the size of the plot
* Support for sliding intervals (i.e. the last 5 minutes)
* Support for (near) real-time data via web sockets
* Support for server side rendering (nested svg elements?)
